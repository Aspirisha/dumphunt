# dumphunt
Application for bums who prefer searching shit in dumps to buying shit in molls

## Basic functionality
Service stores information about local dumps and different stuff that is available [hmm...] there. It allows

* Searching for treasures in your neighbourhood
* Create new junk yard location
* Post the shit you are going to throw
    * add dump location [from predefined set of junk yards]
    * add short description
    * add photo
* Junk surfing - just exploring the vicinity. Definitiely much fun
* Post info about stuff you see on a dump you are visiting

## Open problems
* Why would anyone be interested in sharing info? 
    * rewards system? 
    * give smartphones to bums and pay them 10 cents per useful information unit?
        * smells shit since needs another bums to verify the bums above  
* Many starving bums and only lucky first one gets the loot. So what's the point of ever going somewhere if you know your chances to find something are so low?
